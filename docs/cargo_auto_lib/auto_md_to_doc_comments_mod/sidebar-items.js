It works with workspaces and single projects. From this doc comments `cargo doc` will generated the documentation and auto-completion. We don’t want to manually copy this segments. We want them to be automatically in sync. We will just run this function before every `cargo doc` with an automation task. The `auto_md_to_doc_comments` function must be executed in the project root folder where is the Cargo.toml file. First it searches all the rs files in src, tests and examples folders. If they contain the markers, than finds the md file and the named segment and include it as doc comments into the rs file. The markers are always in pairs: start and end. So exactly the content in between is changed. The markers are always comments, so they don’t change the code. It works only for files with LF line delimiter.
