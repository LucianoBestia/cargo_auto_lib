My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Try it

In your rust project root directory (where the Cargo.toml is)  
first install [cargo-auto](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-auto) and generate a new helper project:

```bash
cargo install cargo-auto
cargo auto new
```

In a new editor open the generated directory `automation_tasks_rs` as an independent rust project. There is already this dependency in `Cargo.toml`:  

```toml
cargo_auto_lib="0.7.27"
```

Preview the code and observe all the `auto_*` functions from `cargo_auto_lib`.  
Example:  

fn task_release() {  
    auto_semver_increment_patch();  
    auto_cargo_toml_to_md();  
    auto_lines_of_code("");  
    auto_build();  
}  

Go back to your main rust project.  
Add markers to the beginning of README.md (don't copy the numbers 1 and 2):  

```md
1 [comment]: # (auto_cargo_toml_to_md start)
2 [comment]: # (auto_cargo_toml_to_md end)
```

Run (in your main rust project):

```bash
cargo auto release
```

With a little luck, it included the data of Cargo.toml into the `README.md` inside the markers:  

![auto_cargo_toml_to_md](https://github.com/bestia-dev/cargo_auto_lib/raw/main/images/auto_cargo_toml_to_md.png "auto_cargo_toml_to_md")

## based on simple functions

All the functions have extensive help/docs to describe how they work.  
It is nice when you use a code editor with IntelliSense like VSCode.  

## Caveats

This crate will attempt to edit Cargo.toml. Unfortunately there's no great robust way right now to edit TOML file preserving formatting and comments and such, so right now I use just regex to do this.
If you find that the heuristics don't work for you though please let me know and I'll try to check in a fix!

## learn something new every day

I needed to copy large text into doc comments.  
It means every line must get a prefix like `///`.  
In VSCode I selected the text, press  
`alt+shift+i`
Now I have `multiple cursors` on the end of every selected lines.  
I press the key
`home`
And now I have multiple cursors on the beginning of every line.  
I type (insert):
`///`  
and it's done ! Great !

## TODO

Automate badges for crates.io, doc.rs, lib.rs, license, crev review. Check if they exist and create badges.

## cargo crev reviews and advisory

We live in times of danger with [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack).  
It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
Please, spread this info.  
You can also read reviews quickly on the web:  
<https://web.crev.dev/rust-reviews/crates/>  

## open-source free and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful,  
please buy me a beer donating on my [paypal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
